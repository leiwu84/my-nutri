# my-nutri
MyNutri â€“ Track your meals, log nutrition for foods, and calculate nutrition for your recipes.

## Highlights
1. The foods/meals that **you** eat.
1. Identity your food and meal by the combination of name and kind. 
    
    !!! note

        Having a common name while further distinguished by kind allows easier query of all kinds of items that share the same name.

    !!! example

        1. `Apple` is a food name; while `Fuji` is its food kind.
        1. `Chia Seed Pudding` is a meal name; while `with Milk`, `with Yogurt`, and `with Mango Juice` can be its meal kind, so that you can easily record variations of your meal.

1. The consumption table allows you to specify the portion (in the unit of percentage [%]) of a meal. **Very useful when you cook for your family and you measure the amount of the ingradients for the whole meal, and you only eat a portion.**
