# my-nutri
MyNutri â€“ Track your meals, log nutrition for foods, and calculate nutrition for your recipes.

## Highlights
1. The *foods*/*meals* that **you** *consume*. It has 4 relational tables:
        
    1. A `food` table. It contains its nurtions based on a reference amount. E.g. 100 g, 100 mL, etc.
    1. A `meal` table. It contains the a list of foods with the correponding amount. That means, a meal can contain multiple foods, and a food can be in multiple meal.
    1. A `mealfoodlink` table. It contains the relationship between meal and food. The amount of a food in a meal can, of course, be different than the reference amount in the `food` table.
    1. A `consumption` table. It contains your consumed food or meal per timestamp. A row in this table can be a food or a meal with the consumed amount. This amount can, of course, be different than the reference amount in the `food` table and the amount in the `mealfoodlink` table.

1. Identity your food and meal by the combination of name and kind. 
    
    !!! note

        Having a common name while further distinguished by kind allows easier query of all kinds of items that share the same name.

    !!! example

        1. `Apple` is a food name; while `Fuji` is its food kind.
        1. `Chia Seed Pudding` is a meal name; while `with Milk`, `with Yogurt`, and `with Mango Juice` can be its meal kind, so that you can easily record variations of your meal.

1. The consumption table allows you to specify the portion (in the unit of percentage [%]) of a meal. **Very useful when you cook for your family and you measure the amount of the ingradients for the whole meal, and you only eat a portion.**
